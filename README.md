# This is a work in progress
 
 This is a very early stage of development. For now implementing UX, no encoding functionality is implemented yet.

# FFEnc
 FFmpeg based encoder for high quality, bulk and repetitive video/sequence/audio transcoding
 
 This will wrap my [SendTo_FFmpeg](https://github.com/keerah/SendTo_FFmpeg) tools experience into a simple but versatile GUI tool.

# The concept

 Minimal dependencies

 High usability for bulk and repetetive tasks
 
 Maximum functionality while keeping the UX clean and logical

 Robust execution and encoding settings application/editing

 Usage flexibility both using GUI and command line

 High quality encoding

 Minimal constrains, allowing a user to built whatever they want, and troubleshoot ffmpeg problems and incompatibilities using logs (a live log for each file)
